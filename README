meta-oracle-java
================

This is a layer providing recipes for Oracle java packages. These are
generated from Oracle's publically released binary java packages.

The Oracle Java files are released by Oracle under "Oracle Binary Code License
Agreement for Java SE" license.

More information about license: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/documentation/java-se-bcl-license-430205.html
or 
http://www.oracle.com/

These recipes will not build by default. In order to build them you need to
enable "oracle-java" license by adding this line in your local.conf

LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "oracle_java"

Notes
=====
There are some known install problems for JRE packages due to dependencies
reported by RPM package manager. Switching to DEB or IPK packaging temporarily
fixes this.
ie:
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_deb"
or
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_ipk"
in your 'local.conf' file

=====================

Please substitute "PATCH" with "PATCH v2" if you are submitting a revised version after
