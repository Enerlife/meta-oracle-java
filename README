This is the meta-oracle-java layer modified to latest java 1.7 available for ARM. At
time of this writing it is "U75 Build 13" and as per Oracle it shall be the last for
Java 1.7.

Since Oracle changed the website, the original yocto procject mantained layer is not
working. I first updated the recipe to look for lastest available build of Java 1.7
and download it. Howver Oracle also changed download policy, now one needs to login
and agree with license before download. This way neither yocto or my version of the
recipe will work.

Workaround:

Manually login into Oracle website
Manually download package ejre-7u75-fcs-b13-linux-arm-vfp-hflt-client_headless-18_dec_2014.tar.gz
Move downloaded file to download dir of you Yocto build system

Now my version of the layer shall install normaly.

Everything else below is still valid.

PS: if anyone has better idea I am open to try.

meta-oracle-java
================

This is a layer providing recipes for Oracle java packages. These are
generated from Oracle's publically released binary java packages.

The Oracle Java files are released by Oracle under "Oracle Binary Code License
Agreement for Java SE" license.

More information about license: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/documentation/java-se-bcl-license-430205.html
or 
http://www.oracle.com/

These recipes will not build by default. In order to build them you need to
enable "oracle-java" license by adding this line in your local.conf

LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "oracle_java"

Notes
=====
There are some known install problems for JRE packages due to dependencies
reported by RPM package manager. Switching to DEB or IPK packaging temporarily
fixes this.
ie:
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_deb"
or
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_ipk"
in your 'local.conf' file

Where to Send Patches
=====================
Please submit any patches against this layer to the Yocto mailing list like:

git send-email --to=yocto@yoctoproject.org -M -1 --subject-prefix="meta-oracle-java][PATCH"

Please substitute "PATCH" with "PATCH v2" if you are submitting a revised version after
addressing feedback (or v3, v4 etc.)
